This code snippet appears to be a React component using Apollo Client with a `useLazyQuery` hook to fetch data from a GraphQL server. The code snippet shows the definition of the `useLazyQuery` hook with a callback for when the query is completed and another callback for handling errors.

Let's break down the code:

1. `const [me] = useLazyQuery(ME_QUERY, { ... })`: The `useLazyQuery` hook is a part of Apollo Client and is used to fetch data from a GraphQL server. In this case, it is fetching data using the `ME_QUERY`, and the response is stored in the `me` variable. The `me` variable will be an array containing the query function and the result object.

2. `ME_QUERY`: This variable holds the GraphQL query that will be sent to the server to retrieve data about the current user.

3. `onCompleted`: This callback function is executed when the query is successfully completed and data is returned from the server. In this case, it sets the `appLoading` state to `false`, indicating that the app has finished loading, and sets the `loggedOut` state to `false`.

4. `onError`: This callback function is executed when an error occurs during the query. In this case, it removes the token from the local storage, sets the `loggedOut` state to `true`, and sets the `appLoading` state to `false`. Additionally, it checks the error message and displays an appropriate error message using the `message.error()` function from an external library (possibly `antd` or `antd-message`).

Overall, this code snippet is related to user authentication and likely handles the retrieval of user information from the GraphQL server and manages the loading state and error handling accordingly.
